		<h2> Introducing The Good Boy </h2>
		<p> The Good Boy started out as my final year Engineering project. I was in a team of 7 people and we set out
		to design and implement an autonomous tennis ball retrieval robot, using a Raspberry Pi microcontroller as it's brain,
		OpenCV to perform tennis ball recognition, and a variety of other sensors and actuators. The project was completed over
		the course of 8 months, along with a trove of technical documentation highlighting the requirements of the system, the design of the system
		and the Validation and Verification of the system. In the end, on the last day, the following photos and video shows what it could do at the end
		of our efforts. <br/>

		The end of the Capstone project (and final year in engineering for the whole team) approached, we did well in the final year project, and The Good Boy 
		was entrusted to me. Already the gears were turning for me for the next steps with The Good Boy...

		<h2> The Dream </h2>
			<p> Fast forward a few weeks, and The Good Boy is with me. I have plans to turn it into a commercial product, with many ideas for the 
			different functions that it should have (on top of the ones we managed to implement), as well as to complete some of the requirements that
			we did not manage to complete due to lack of time and resources. Maybe I'll find a good market for tennis ball retrieval robots.
			And even if I don't manage sell it and make a fortune (told you I was a dreamer), it's bound to be a fantastic adventure giving the robot a
			redesign. </p>
