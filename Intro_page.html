		<h1>Kevin Mano says: HELLO WORLD!</h1>
		<p> Welcome to my personal website! I plan to use this as a little showcase for projects that I do, and to share my thoughts and ideas.</p>

		<div id="intro_brief">
		  <h2>Me, In Brief</h2>
			<p>I am a recent graduate the Mechatronics Engineering program at McMaster University. 
			I'm passionate about learning, and engineering, and science and math, and lots of other nerdy things.
			I've been called a dreamer a time or two, and I don't think that observation is inaccurate. 
			But more than that, I try to dream of things to do, and then I set out to do them.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="showcase">
		  <h3>The showcase </h3>
			<p> As mentioned, this website is supposed to be about projects that I've worked on, 
			and so below are links to the ones I have good records to.</p>
